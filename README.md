# Report on the Account Management Project

## 1. Project Overview
The project is a **command-line account management system** written in **Go**, capable of adding, searching, and deleting accounts. It also includes **email validation** functionality. The system stores user data in a `buffer.json` file and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## 2. Key Features
- **Menu-based interaction** allowing users to:
  - Add a new account
  - Search for an existing account
  - Delete an account
  - Exit the program
- **Email validation** using an external API.
- **Data persistence** via a JSON file (`buffer.json`).
- **Executable binary** can be generated for different OS using `go build`.

## 3. Project Structure
The project consists of three key files:

### **1. `main.go`** (Entry point)
- Handles user interaction and displays the menu.
- Calls corresponding functions from `files_work.go`.
- Implements error handling for invalid input.

### **2. `files_work.go`** (File operations)
- Manages account records (adding, searching, and deleting).
- Reads and writes to `buffer.json`.
- Calls functions from `account.go` to handle account-related logic.

### **3. `account.go`** (Account data and validation)
- Defines the `Person` struct.
- Implements input functions for capturing user details.
- Provides email validation using an external API.
- Converts account data to JSON for storage.

## 4. Technical Analysis
### **Strengths:**
âœ… Well-structured with modular separation (`main.go`, `files_work.go`, `account.go`).
âœ… Uses JSON for persistent data storage.
âœ… Implements email validation for account creation.
âœ… Provides a user-friendly command-line interface.
âœ… Generates an executable file (`myapp.exe` or `myapp`).

### **Areas for Improvement:**
ðŸ”¹ **Error handling:** Some functions lack robust error handling, especially with file I/O.
ðŸ”¹ **Input validation:** Need better input validation to prevent incorrect data entries.
ðŸ”¹ **Concurrency:** Currently, all operations are sequential; adding goroutines could improve performance.
ðŸ”¹ **Logging:** Implementing structured logging would help debug and monitor system behavior.

## 5. How to Build and Run
### **Building the Executable:**
```sh
go build -o myapp main.go
```
For Windows:
```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe main.go
```

### **Running the Program:**
```sh
./myapp   # Linux/macOS
myapp.exe # Windows
```

## 6. Conclusion
The project is a functional and well-organized **account management system** with email validation and persistent storage. With improvements in error handling, input validation, and concurrency, it could be further optimized for better performance and usability.
